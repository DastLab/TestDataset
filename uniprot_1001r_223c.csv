In response to reduction of intracellular ATP levels, AMPK activates energy-producing pathways and inhibits energy-consuming processes: inhibits protein, carbohydrate and lipid biosynthesis, as well as cell growth and proliferation. AMPK acts via direct phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes, and by longer-term effects via phosphorylation of transcription regulators. Also acts as a regulator of cellular polarity by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton; probably by indirectly activating myosin. Beta non-catalytic subunit acts as a scaffold on which the AMPK complex assembles, via its C-terminus that bridges alpha (PRKAA1 or PRKAA2) and gamma subunits (PRKAG1, PRKAG2 or PRKAG3).","Belongs to the 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase beta subunit family.","IPR006828; AMP_prot_kin_bsu_interact-dom","PF04739; AMPKBI; 1","","GO:0044281; P:small molecule metabolic process; TAS:Reactome","","","","PRKAB2","","","O43741","O43741; 75-272","DIP-39763N","O43741","","O43741","O43741","O43741","","hsa:5565","uc001epe.3","5565","","NOG238368","","HOG000230597","O43741","K07199","EDECPVQ","21560","O43741","","","","","SM01010; AMPKBI; 1","","","","AMPK is a heterotrimer of an alpha catalytic subunit (PRKAA1 or PRKAA2), a beta (PRKAB1 or PRKAB2) and a gamma non-catalytic subunits (PRKAG1, PRKAG2 or PRKAG3).","; ; ","IPI00013905","Hs.50732","","","","O43741","ENSG00000131791; Homo sapiens","type: modified residue; description: Phosphoserine; evidence: 2 4 7 6; ; ; 184","ENST00000584647; ENSP00000463518; ENSG00000266198","HBG050430","EOG4W9J4H","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4EAJ; X-ray; 2.61 A; B=189-272","4EAJ","O43741","type: helix; ; ; 210 - 213","type: strand; ; ; 262 - 271","type: turn; ; ; 236 - 239","","GC01M146627","HGNC:9379; PRKAB2","602741; gene","NX_O43741","HS_PRKAB2","","","","","","Phosphorylated when associated with the catalytic subunit (PRKAA1 or PRKAA2).

RISC uses the mature miRNA or siRNA as a guide for slicer-directed cleavage of homologous mRNAs to repress gene expression. Associates mainly with siRNAs of 21 nucleotide in length and preferentially recruits small RNAs with a 5' terminal adenosine. Probably involved in antiviral RNA silencing. Associates with siRNA derived from cucumber mosaic virus (CMV).

Plays a role in the final digestion of peptides generated from hydrolysis of proteins by gastric and pancreatic proteases. May be involved in the metabolism of regulatory peptides of diverse cell types, responsible for the processing of peptide hormones, such as angiotensin III and IV, neuropeptides, and chemokines and involved the cleavage of peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex class II molecules of antigen presenting cells. May have a role in angiogenesis (By similarity). In case of feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection, serves as a receptor for FCoV spike glycoprotein. It is as well a receptor for other serogroup I coronaviruses, like canine coronavirus (CCoV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E).

Adaptor protein complexes function in protein transport via transport vesicles in different membrane traffic pathways. Adaptor protein complexes are vesicle coat components and appear to be involved in cargo selection and vesicle formation. AP-2 is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis in which cargo proteins are incorporated into vesicles surrounded by clathrin (clathrin-coated vesicles, CCVs) which are destined for fusion with the early endosome. The clathrin lattice serves as a mechanical scaffold but is itself unable to bind directly to membrane components. Clathrin-associated adaptor protein (AP) complexes which can bind directly to both the clathrin lattice and to the lipid and protein components of membranes are considered to be the major clathrin adaptors contributing the CCV formation. AP-2 also serves as a cargo receptor to selectively sort the membrane proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. AP-2 seems to play a role in the recycling of synaptic vesicle membranes from the presynaptic surface. AP-2 recognizes Y-X-X-[FILMV] (Y-X-X-Phi) and [ED]-X-X-X-L-[LI] endocytosis signal motifs within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules. AP-2 may also play a role in maintaining normal post-endocytic trafficking through the ARF6-regulated, non-clathrin pathway. The AP-2 alpha subunit binds polyphosphoinositide-containing lipids, positioning AP-2 on the membrane. The AP-2 alpha subunit acts via its C-terminal appendage domain as a scaffolding platform for endocytic accessory proteins. The AP-2 alpha and AP-2 sigma subunits are thought to contribute to the recognition of the [ED]-X-X-X-L-[LI] motif.","Belongs to the adaptor complexes large subunit family.","IPR013041; Coatomer/clathrin_app_Ig-like","PF02883; Alpha_adaptinC2; 1","","GO:0006886; P:intracellular protein transport; IEA:InterPro","","","AP-2 appears to be excluded from internalizing CCVs and to disengage from sites of endocytosis seconds before internalization of the nascent CCV.","Ap2a2","Adtab","S11276; S11276","P18484","P18484; 9-607, 702-938","DIP-29765N","P18484","MINT-93156","P18484","","P18484","","","RGD:71015","","","NOG303101","","","P18484","","","","P18484","2.60.40.1030; Clathrin_a-adaptin_app_Ig-like; 1","","PIRSF037091; AP2_complex_alpha; 1","","SM00809; Alpha_adaptinC2; 1","SSF49348; Clath_adapt; 1","","","Adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) is a heterotetramer composed of two large adaptins (alpha-type subunit AP2A1 or AP2A2 and beta-type subunit AP2B1), a medium adaptin (mu-type subunit AP2M1) and a small adaptin (sigma-type subunit AP2S1).

Formation of the active enzyme involves a self-maturation process in which the active site pyruvoyl group is generated from an internal serine residue via an autocatalytic post-translational modification. Two non-identical subunits are generated from the proenzyme in this reaction, and the pyruvate is formed at the N-terminus of the alpha chain, which is derived from the carboxyl end of the proenzyme. The post-translation cleavage follows an unusual pathway, termed non-hydrolytic serinolysis, in which the side chain hydroxyl group of the serine supplies its oxygen atom to form the C-terminus of the beta chain, while the remainder of the serine residue undergoes an oxidative deamination to produce ammonia and the pyruvoyl group blocking the N-terminus of the alpha chain.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recognizes and selectively binds the transmembrane domain of TA proteins in the cytosol. This complex then targets to the endoplasmic reticulum by membrane-bound receptors, where the tail-anchored protein is released for insertion. This process is regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis. ATP binding drives the homodimer towards the closed dimer state, facilitating recognition of newly synthesized TA membrane proteins. ATP hydrolysis is required for insertion. Subsequently, the homodimer reverts towards the open dimer state, lowering its affinity for the membrane-bound receptor, and returning it to the cytosol to initiate a new round of targeting.","Belongs to the arsA ATPase family.","IPR016300; ATPase_ArsA/Get3","PF02374; ArsA_ATPase; 1","","GO:0006810; P:transport; IEA:UniProtKB-KW","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FBtr0170249; FBpp0168741; FBgn0142262","dmo:Dmoj_GI19524","","","","","","","B4KTG7","K01551","","","","","PTHR10803; PTHR10803; 1","","","","","","","Homodimer.","","","","","","","","","","","","EOG4905RN","","","","","3.6.-.-","","","","","","","MF_03112; Asna1_Get3; 1","TIGR00345; arsA; 1","type: active site; status: by similarity; ; ; 58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","type: binding site; status: by similarity; description: ATP; ; ; 263","","type: metal ion-binding site; status: by similarity; description: Zinc, shared with dimeric partner; ; ; 278","","","","","","","type: nucleotide phosphate-binding region; status: by similarity; description: ATP; ; ; 29 - 36","","","","FBgn0142262; DmojGI19524","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
